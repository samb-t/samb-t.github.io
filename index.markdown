## About
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Durham University supervised by [Chris G. Willcocks](https://cwkx.github.io). My interests revolve around deep learning with a focus on unsupervised learning, 
generative modelling, and machine reasoning. I believe that effective neural models should be able to learn without supervision, in a similar manner to humans.
I am a teaching assistant on the [Deep Learning](https://cwkx.github.io/teaching.html) sub-module at Durham.
