Each summer our team typically has several open positions for research interns which we advertise for in the last few months of the year ([posted here](https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/search?lc=Cambridge%2C%20Cambridgeshire%2C%20United%20Kingdom&et=Internship&l=en_us)). In Microsoft Research Health Futures UK, we focus on the development and understanding of large multimodal models for healthcare as exemplified by our work in [Project MAIRA](https://aka.ms/maira). As an intern within our team you will have the opportunity to 
* Deepen your expertise in multimodal deep learning and contribute to our ambitious research agenda.
* Conduct experimentation with world-class computational resources.
* Learn in a team with a strong culture of collaboration and rigorous research.

If you are passionate about multimodal deep learning for healthcare and are enrolled in a PhD program with a track record of publication in conferences or journals within machine learning and/or healthcare, feel free to reach out at [sbondtaylor@microsoft.com](mailto:sbondtaylor@microsoft.com). In particular, if you have any interesting ideas or projects which you think could benefit from working in our team. Internships are a great way to explore something new for a few months, gain experience using cloud infrastructure, and improve your software engineering skills.
