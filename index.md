## About
I am a senior researcher in the [Health Futures](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/medical-health-genomics) group at Microsoft Research Cambridge, researching multi-modal modals for medical imaging as a member of the [Biomedical Imaging Team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/biomedical-imaging). As part of [Project MAIRA](https://aka.ms/maira), some of the papers I have been involved in include [RadEdit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12865), an approach for stress-testing biomedical vision models by using diffusion models to edit images; and [RAD-DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10815), where we studied whether pre-training on multi-modal biomedical data can actually be a hindrance compared to uni-modal methods.

Prior to joining Microsoft I studied for my PhD at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/), where I explored how generative imaging models can be efficiently scaled to high resolutions, with papers including [$\infty$-Diff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18242) and [Unleashing Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12701).
