## Introduction

This is the first in a series of posts revolving around the latest and greatest in deep generative modelling (think Style-GAN, Very Deep VAEs, Denoising Diffusion, etc). In particular, we will look form a julia perspective

If you are doing/have just finished an introductory course on deep learning and are interested in generative models but prefer a less dense approach to learning than reading academic papers directly and like code examples to make everything clear, then these are the posts for you.


If you are already familiar with these methods but are interested in picking up Julia then feel free to check out the [repo](javascipt:void(0)) with code for everything here. With that said, a few bits here and there in the julia-verse might not be clear but hopefully the related posts will help out.

In this post we're going to have a look at what julia is and why you should care.
